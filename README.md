# MONIKA
Multi-Omic Network Inference &amp; Knockout Analysis

This tool performs both network inference and integration in a multi-omic setting. Following single layer inference via a prior-incorporating Gaussian Graphical Model, multiple layers are inferred via Bayesian sequential updating. 
Target nodes and biological pathways are identified via significance testing of knockouts and diffusion analysis.

The tool has been tested on colorectal cancer datasets.
